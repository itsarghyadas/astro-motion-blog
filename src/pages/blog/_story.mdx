# How we added MagicUI to Astro?

I have just created this blog to see how performant Astro.js is and how easily we can integrate MagicUI here. Let me walk you through the setup process step by step.

## 1. Create a New Astro Project

First, create a fresh Astro project using the following command:

<CopyableCode code="npm create astro@latest" language="bash" />

During the setup, you'll be prompted with several configuration questions. Here's what I recommend:

- Choose a template
- Enable TypeScript (with strict mode)
- Install dependencies
- Initialize git repository (optional)

## 2. Add React Support

Since MagicUI works with React, we need to add React support to our Astro project:

<CopyableCode code="npx astro add react" language="bash" />

## 3. Add Tailwind CSS

MagicUI requires Tailwind CSS. Install it using:

<CopyableCode code="npx astro add tailwind" language="bash" />

## 4. Configure the Project

Create a `styles/globals.css` file in your `src` folder with:

<CopyableCode
  code="@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;"
  language="css"
/>

Then, update your `astro.config.mjs` to prevent duplicate Tailwind base styles:

<CopyableCode
  code={`import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    tailwind(),
  ],
});`}
  language="javascript"
/>

## 5. Install MagicUI Components

Now you can start adding MagicUI components to your project. For example, to add the button component:

<CopyableCode code="npx shadcn@latest add button" language="bash" />

That's it! You can now use MagicUI components in your Astro project. The setup process was surprisingly straightforward, and the performance is excellent.
